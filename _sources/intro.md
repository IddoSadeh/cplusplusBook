# Welcome to Programado

This website is built by <http://www.isadeh.com>. I aim to use this website to upload and organize all my teaching materials. Currently I am working on a [C++](cplusplus/start.md) textbook. In the future I'd like to compile a [AP CSA - Java  textbook](java/start.md) as well as an [Intro to Programming wtih Python textbook](py/start.md).


<!-- # My Teaching Ideology

Mastering the art of surfing begins with the first few lessons, where you learn the essentials - safety, etiquette, and techniques for riding the white waves. Once you've honed these skills, you may find yourself drawn towards the thrill of tackling green waves. Though an instructor can provide guidance and advice for navigating these more challenging waves, it ultimately becomes an art form - your knack for timing the wave is forged in the crucible of multiple wipeouts and relentless comebacks.

The approach to learning in the textbooks i've written draws parallels to this surfing journey. In the initial chapter, I'll equip you with the fundamental skills needed to ensure a smoother learning process. Subsequent chapters will challenge you with varying degrees of difficulty, comparable to the unpredictable green waves, and you are expected to persist and swim back to the lineup time you stumble. -->
