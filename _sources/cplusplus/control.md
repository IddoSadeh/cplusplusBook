# Control Structres

In the last chpater we got technical and learned about Variables and Data types. In this chapter we will tone it down a notch and learn how to write more functional programs using control structures. Control structures dictate the order in which lines of code are executed in a program. In C++, as with most other programming languages, the basic control structures are selection (making decisions) and repetition (loops). By the end of this chapter you should know how to use:
- If statments.
- Switch statements.
- For loops.
- While loops.
- Do-While loops.
